X-Plane Communication Plug-In
===
A plugin for X-Plane application to test autopilot in its simulation.  
Basically it feeds plane telemetry to a specific shared memory segment and copies some of this telemetry back to X-Plane
(mainly updated actuators positions)

Additionaly it renders small PFD monitor with flight directors inside X-Plane to test autopilot stability in hand-flying mode.
